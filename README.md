# Udacity FEND
## Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone

### How to Run/Install
**Easy way:** Play the live demo hosted with GitHub Pages at [https://ianclaudius.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html](https://ianclaudius.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html)

**Hard way:** Download or install the repo at [https://github.com/ianclaudius/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git](https://github.com/ianclaudius/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git) in order to play locally.

### How to Play
1. Move the player using the arrow keys.
2. Avoid the bugs.
3. Do like chickens do: _get to the other side._ (And drown, apparentlyâ€”not sure why the default victory tiles are water.)
4. Both victory and defeat result in the exact same reward: The chance to do it again.
5. Laud my AAA production values.
